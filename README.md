# Project Description
This project aims to develop a system that tests whether a bicep curl exercise is performed correctly and counts the number of repetitions using Python and HTML. The implementation utilizes OpenCV for computer vision tasks and leverages the internal webcam to capture video feed. The captured video is processed to analyze the posture during the bicep curl exercise, ensuring it is performed correctly, and to count the number of curls performed. The results are displayed on an index.html page, providing real-time feedback.

# Features
Posture Analysis: Ensures that the bicep curl exercise is performed with proper form.
Repetition Counting: Counts the number of bicep curls performed.
Real-Time Feedback: Displays results on an index.html page.
# Technology Stack
Python: For backend processing and logic.

OpenCV: For computer vision tasks.

HTML: For the frontend interface.

Internal Webcam: For capturing live video feed.
